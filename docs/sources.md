# Samples

You can get samples from **a lot of places**.

I'll list some sources of samples you can use:

- [SampleRadar](https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download)
- [OLPC (One Laptop Per Child)](https://wiki.laptop.org/go/Free_sound_samples)
- [WaveWorld](https://modarchive.org/forums/index.php?topic=2406.0)
- [Woolyss' chiptune samples](https://modarchive.org/forums/index.php?topic=2405.0)

You can also rip samples from other modules.

# Instruments

A very popular source of XI instruments is [KIArchive](https://archive.org/details/kiarchive.7z).
This one is highly recommended, since all the instruments are already set up for you!

# Modules

The most popular source of modules is [The Mod Archive](https://modarchive.org/).

[ModLand](https://modland.com/pub/modules/Fasttracker%202/) is also very popular, and has a lot of modules!

There's plenty other ones out there.

# Information

[The Mod Archive forums](https://modarchive.org/forums/index.php) and the
[Tracker Music Discord server](https://discord.gg/4TD8mxtw) are my go-tos!
