# MILKYTRACKER UI

Here, we'll be covering the MT's UI and how to navigate around it.

I'll use shortcuts to indicate keyboard actions, such as `Ctrl+S`.
Keep in mind that `Ctrl` is the control key, `Sh` is the shift key, `Spc` is the space bar and `Alt` is, well, the alt key!

Also, I'll be covering the various elements of the UI by covering the elements you'll be using commonly, and then the rest.

# Startup

Upon first startup, you are going to be greeted by the MT splash screen:

![splash.png](../img/splash.png)

Afterwards, MT loads the [main window](#main-window).

The startup splash screen is easily disabled in the settings (`Misc. > Other > Splash screen`).

# Main window

![ui_startUpWin.png](../img/ui_startUpWin.png)

This is the only real GUI window in MT, all other "windows" that I refer to are just subwindows within the main window.

From here, you will be managing everything, from modules to the way your tracker works and looks.

You can always return to the main window by hitting `Ctrl+X`.

The elements in this window, from top-left to bottom-right, are:

1. [The general editor](#general-editor)
2. [The instrument menu](#instrument-menu)
3. [The sample menu](#sample-menu)
4. [The scopes](#scopes)
5. [The playlist](#playlist)

# General editor

![ui_generalEditor.png](../img/ui_generalEditor.png)

The general editor is the top-left window visible from the [main window](#main-window).

From here, you'll manage various properties relating to your song, your editing of the song, as well as toggle other windows.
