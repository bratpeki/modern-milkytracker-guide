Welcome to page 0!

**Before we begin, let's state what this guide *actually* is.**

It's meant to be a modern collection of knowledge relating to the MilkyTracker music tracker.<br>
"Modern" implies:

- **that it is presented in a modern format (Markdown, GitHub standard)** and
- **that it is clean of stale links and information which was relevant for very old versions**.

I'll make the following assumptions:

- You use the FastTracker II edit mode
- You are using MilkyTracker version 1.03.00 on PC devices
- You're making music using the XM format

As for the Markdown code, it is written following these rules:

- No line should exceed 100 characters unless neccessary
- Links to docs are in all caps, every other link's text is copied over
- In the code, avoid using HTML code unless neccessary (i.e. for a direct line break, `<br>`)
- Make moving between docs easy and accessible

Currently, the guide is meant to be a collection of the following information:

- General tracker basics
- MilkyTracker basics
- Good sources of information and samples
- Information on the XM module format
- Information on the XI instrument format
- An index of (if I succeed) all MilkyTracker options, settings and functionalities
- More advanced tips relating to MilkyTracker (mixing, quick editing, etc)
- Where to find modules
- Compiling MilkyTracker

If all goes well, this guide should move you from having no clue what you're doing to being
competent at using MilkyTracker.<br>
And if you're well into using it or some other tracker, there might still be interesting information
to find.

Also, from this page onward, MilkyTracker will be referred to as MT or, affectionately, Milky.

This guide assumes you have basic music knowledge and an understanding of elementary musical terms.
These are mainly going to be terms like "pitch", "sample", "scale", and so on. Technical terms, like
"string", might also appear. You can easily look all of them up, so this shouldn't be an issue.

Good? Let's move on!
