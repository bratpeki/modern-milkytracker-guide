# A modern guide to MilkyTracker

## Introduction

Welcome to page 0!

**Before we begin, let's state what this guide *actually* is.**

It's meant to be a modern collection of knowledge relating to the MilkyTracker music tracker.<br>
"Modern" implies:
- **that it is presented in a modern format (Markdown)** and
- **that it is clean of stale links and information which was relevant for very old versions**.

Currently, it is meant to be a collection of the following information<sup>1</sup>:

- ❎ General tracker basics
- ❎ MilkyTracker basics
- ❎ Good sources of information and samples
- ❎ Information on the XM module format
- ❎ Information on the XI instrument format
- ❎ An index of (if I succeed) all MilkyTracker options, settings and functionalities
- ❎ More advanced tips relating to MilkyTracker (mixing, quick editing, etc)
- ❎ Where to find modules
- ❎ Compiling MilkyTracker

If all goes well, this guide should move you from having no clue what you're doing to being competent at using MilkyTracker.<br>
And if you're well into using it or some other tracker, there might still be interesting information to find.

Also, from this page onward, MilkyTracker will be referred to as MT or, affectionately, Milky.

Good? Let's move on!
