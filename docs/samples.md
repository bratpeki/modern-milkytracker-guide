MilkyTracker has a significantly more powerful sample editor, in comparison to it's predecesor,
FastTracker II. The features available to you in MT include:

- Creating a new sample with a specified sample size
- Waveform generators for:
    - sine waves,
    - square waves,
    - triangle waves,
    - sawtooth waves,
    - noise
    - silence (which clears the sample)
- Volume boosting, fading and normalizing
- Reversing
- Smoothing
- Equalization
- ProTracker boosting
- Resampling

and some less important features.

Here, we'll be looking at how you can use these features to create and manipulate samples.

# Starting point

When you open the sample editor (using `Ctrl+S` or `Smp. Ed.` from the
[general editor buttons window](./ui.md#general-editor-buttons-window)),
you are greeted with this window:

These UI elements, and their basic functionality, are covered [here](./ui.md#sample-editor).
