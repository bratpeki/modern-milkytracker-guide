## samples.md

<!-- TODO: Dropdown or drop-down? -->

From the sample manipulation drop-down menu, I'm missing:

- Cross-fade
- Change sign
- Swap byte order
- DC normalize
- DC offset...
- Everything in Ext. paste

## ui.md

The `Min` and `REP` buttons in the [sample editor](./ui.md#sample-editor).
