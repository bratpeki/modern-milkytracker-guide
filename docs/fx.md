# Effect glossary

Here, we'll be covering effects you will *commonly* use.

What you should keep in mind is
that some effects play differently on MODs than on XMs.
This is called playback mode and can be found
by clicking on the `OPTIONS` button in the top-left section
of the main UI.
We'll keep in mind that the playback mode is always set to `Fasttracker 2.x`
(that is, that you're composing in XM).

All effects that we leave out, and `MOD` playback mode specifications can be found in the
`/docs/MilkyTracker.html` section of the original MT repo.
You can find that doc **in dark mode** in my fork
[here](https://github.com/bratpeki/MilkyTracker/blob/master/docs/MilkyTracker.html).
