# Effect glossary

Here, we'll be covering effects
based on how commonly they are used and
what they are used for.

Since there are **a lot** of effects,
most of which you will, frankly, *"never"* use,
I'll be covering the commonly used ones in much detail.

This part will be very similar to the effect glossary in the
`/docs/MilkyTracker.html` section of the original MT repo.
You can find that doc **in dark mode** in my fork
[here](https://github.com/bratpeki/MilkyTracker/blob/master/docs/MilkyTracker.html).
**Any effect that is not covered here will be listed in the doc.**
