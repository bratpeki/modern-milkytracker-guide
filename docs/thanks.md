My thanks go out to:

- Olav SÃ¸rensen, AKA 8bitbubsy, for his help with understanding the XM format. His contribution to
  tracking is immense, take a look at his DOS and Amiga tracker clones over on his
  [GitHub page](https://github.com/8bitbubsy) or his [website](https://16-bits.org/).
- The wonderful people over at the [Tracker Music Discord server](https://discord.gg/4TD8mxtw), moderated
  by [Vectif](https://www.youtube.com/c/Vectif).
